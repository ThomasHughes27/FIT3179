        <h1>FIT3179 Assignment 2 Thomas Hughes: World Happiness Report 2015-2019</h1>
        <p>This visualisation analyses data from the World Happiness Report, who calculate 'Happiness Scores' based upon data from the Gallup World Poll. Gallup asks thousands of respondents in over 150 countries main life evaluation questions, which they answer in the form of a Cantril ladder: 0 being the worst possible life and 10 being the best. The rankings are based entirely off of those survey scores, using Gallup weights to make the estimates representative of each country. </p>
        <p> Then, World Happiness Report aim to explain these happiness scores through six factors: real GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity of charity and volunteering work and trust in the Government. These six factors do not impact the countries happiness score, but instead can be used to compare countries. Each countries calculated factors are compared against a hypthetical country 'Dystopia', which holds the worst of the six factors across all countries. Thus, how much 'better' than Dystopia a country is in one factor, defines their score for that factor. The worst country gets a 0 for the factor, and thus that factor does not contribute, or explain their happiness score at all. </p>

            <h2>World Happiness V GDPPC across 2015-2019</h2>
            <p>It should first be noted that since the Gallup Weights are used to standardise country results, these values are already normalised for this choroplethic map. The map on the left shows each countries average 'Happiness Score' from 2015 to 2019. The darker the blue, the higher average happiness score. The map on the right shows the average GDPPC happiness factor contribution to each countries happiness score. The darker the blue, the bigger contribution GDPPC had on that countries happiness score.</p>
            <p>Since the scale is linear, we can say that the darkness of the blue represents that countries relative position to other countries. Brazil differs alot in terms of its relative Happiness Score and GDPPC contribution to happiness, shown by how the blue is lighter on the second map. This indicates that relative to other countries such as Saudi Arabia who appears to be the opposite, Brazil relies less on the GDPPC factor for its happiness score. It also suggests that money contributes to happiness in differing amounts in different countries, and other factors are relevant in determining happiness. </p>

          <h2>GDPPC V Social Support contributions to happiness per region for individual years 2015-2019</h2>
          <p>Based on preliminary analysis, GDPPC and Social support were the two biggest contributors to happiness. The specific year can be selected and minimum happiness score of nations shown can be adjusted. Regions on the legend can also be selected to highlight a specific region. Across all years, it can be seen that most of the lower values are comprised of nations from Sub-Sahran Africa.</p>
          <p>Denmark is consistently very high in both metrics, while Central African Republic on all years except for 2016(due to missing data), remains one of the lowest performers in both categories. In most years they do not have the smallest bubble however, indicating that other factors are contributing significantly to their happiness. Democratic Republic of the Congo is consistently high in Social Support, but low in GDPPC relatively. This can be contrasted with India, who has the opposite consistently. Uzbekistan is able to have a high social support score while maintaining similar GDPPC levels to India. In 2018, UAE are a significant outlier in the field of GDPPC, but still have a relatively low Social Support score.

          <h2>Top 10 and Bottom 10 Happiest countries per year</h2>
          <p>Specific year can be selected. If "Show All" is selected, all countries from 2015-2019 who ever got into the top 10 or bottom 10 in that time period will be shown. Bars are clickable for highlighting puposes, and can be shift-clicked for easy comparison. The bottom 10 chart sometimes includes a few more than 10 for each year, due to differences in the amount of countries surveyed each year.</p>
          <p>When "Show All" is selected for the Top 10 chart, only 11 countries appear. Interestingly, Austria has only been in the top 10 once in 2019, so essentially the top 10 has been the same countries for the past 5 years. This indicates that there are definitive differences in happiness between countries that do not easily move around.</p>
          <p>This can be contrasted with the Bottom 10 chart, who have 20 countries appearing in the "Show All" selection. This indicates the bottom countries are closer in happiness and move ranking easily. This is expected as these 20 countries are mosly developing countries, who can progress their society much more in a year compared to developed countries. Additionally, it may be because these countries are harder to predict due to potential data collection issues. Noticeable is Burundi, who have quite a low score comparatively.</p>

          <h2>Stacked bar chart of happiness score totals by region over time</h2>
          <p>This chart shows how the relative happiness score total by region has differed very slightly over time. Except for a small decrease in Sub-Saharan Africa and relative increase in Latin America in 2016, happiness score totals compared to all regions have barely changed.</p>
          <p>This indicates that while countries in regions may be improving in happiness, countries from the same region are likely decreasing, so that the region as a whole is not improving compared to other regions. It should be noted that these are totals, not averages, so a region like Sub-Saharan Africa with low happiness scores on average is only a large chunk due to the large amount of countries from that region.</p>
